## BracketBuilder ##
  > For tournament planners and fans to stay up-to-date with bracket results.

## Summary ##
  > BracketBuilder let's you quickly create tournament brackets for any event. Get your tournament up and running with just a few clicks and easily update the results. Create multiple brackets and save them for later. BracketBuilder handles all your tournament planning needs.

## Problem ##
  > Before BracketBuilder, planning your tournament required paper and pencil. You'd have to search the internet for a bracket template with the correct number of teams/players and then manually fill it all in. With BracketBuilder, the entire creation process is automated!

## Solution ##
  > BracketBuilder allows you to create tournament brackets with just a few clicks. Start a new bracket, enter your teams and update the results in real-time.
